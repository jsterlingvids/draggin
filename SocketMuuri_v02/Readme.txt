Need to have new gif instantly added to all viewers sites

Also need to change newgif event name from 'mongo'.......

I need to get the database to correctly update the IDs that I'm now sending to replace position data.

When a new Gif is created, how do I add it into the Database without undoing everything?

In a perfect world everything updates with the ID...
