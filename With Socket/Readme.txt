I'm still having problems syncing all of the positions

One on initial load, and then after I move a box

For syncing the positions on initial load — I think I need to capture the position and the URL and put them both into the same object in the database.

Then I can update from there once both of those positions are captured.

I need to find out how I can make an array with two corresponding objects 

When an object is moved, I need to capture position and URL — then update the position in the database to match the corresponding URL.
